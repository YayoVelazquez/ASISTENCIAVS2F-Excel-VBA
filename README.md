# ASISTENCIAVS2F – Excel VBA Attendance System

This repository documents an Excel-based solution developed by me to support attendance tracking, standardization of absence codes, and automated reporting using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).

The project was created as a practical tool to reduce manual effort, improve data consistency, and provide a structured way to analyze attendance information in a production-oriented environment.

This repository contains a **personal demonstration version** of the project. It reflects the real functionality and logic of the solution, but does not include operational, confidential, or personal data.

## Project Background

While working with attendance data in Excel, I identified recurring issues related to manual handling, inconsistent attendance codes, and limited automation. These issues increased the risk of errors and made reporting time-consuming and unreliable.

To address this, I designed and developed a VBA-driven solution that centralizes the business logic, enforces basic validation rules, and prepares the data for reporting and dashboard usage. The focus of the project is not only on calculations, but also on **process reliability, repeatability, and clarity of information**.
